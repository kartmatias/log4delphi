            <title>Extracting The Archive</title>
			<p>The following instructions can be used for both binary and source 
				distributions.</p>
			<p>There are two archive versions available, a ZIP archive which may
				be extracted using a program like Winzip and a GNU-Zipped 
				Tarball that can also be extracted using Winzip.</p>
			<p>Extract the archive to a location of your choice. A resulting
				folder named <code>log4delphi-</code><em>version</em> will contain
				the contents of the package.</p>

        <section>
            <title>Installing</title>
            <p>There are two ways in which you can install and use Log4Delphi. 
				The first is to install the package and the second is to simply 
				include the source code in your application's code base. Both have 
				pros and cons and should be carefully considered before making the 
				decision.</p>
			<section>
				<title>Installing The Package</title>
				<p>Installing the Log4Delphi package will make it available to be 
					used in all your projects.</p>
				<p>Using a binary distribution (<code>log4delphi-</code><em>version</em>
					<code>-bin.</code><em>archive</em>), the steps are:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Launch Delphi.</li>
					<li>Select <code>Component &gt; Install Packages</code> from
						the main menu.</li>
					<li>Click the <code>Add</code> button.</li>
					<li>Browse to where you extracted the archive and select the
						file named <code>log4delphi.bpl</code>, should be in the
						<code>bin/</code> directory.</li>
					<li>You may need to add the compilation units to your
						library path. To do so, select 
						<code>Tools &gt; Environment Options</code> from the
						main menu.</li>
					<li>Select the Library Tab and add the folder containing
						<code>log4delphi.bpl</code> to the library path.</li>
					<li>You are ready to go!</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Using The Source Code</title>
				<p>This option is best for people who wish to add to or extend 
					Log4Delphi or people who are busy developing Log4Delphi or
					people who wish to include Log4Delphi into their existing
					project's code base.</p>
				<p>Using a source distribution (<code>log4delphi-</code><em>version</em>
					<code>-src.</code><em>archive</em>), the steps are:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Copy all the *.pas files from the 
						<code>log4delphi\src\delphi</code> directory to your
						project's source directory (include the <code>util</code>)
						directory.</li>
					<li>Launch Delphi and Open your project.</li>
					<li>Select <code>Project &gt; Add To Project</code> in the
						main menu.</li>
					<li>In the dialog that opens, select all the Log4Delphi source 
						files <code>*.pas</code> that you added earlier.</li>
					<li>Click the <code>Open</code> button.</li>
					<li>Now build your project.</li>
					<li>You are ready to go!</li>
				</ol>

            <title>Building Log4Delphi From Source</title>
			<p>The source distribution containsa Makefile that can be used to build
				Log4Delphi from source. You can use Borland's Make which is installed
				automatically by Delphi.</p>
			<p>Open a command prompt (MS-DOS Prompt) and navigate to the root source
				directory. Simply issue the command <code>make</code> and Log4Delphi will
				be built.</p>
			<p>The Makefile will fail to complete and will not generate HTML documentation.
				This is because you need to have Apache Forrest installed and set up before
				running make. This is not required to build Log4Delphi, but if you wish
				to generate the HTML docs then you need to have it.</p>

    	<section>
    		<title>Mission Statement</title>
    		<p>The project's mission statement is as folows:</p>
    		<p><em>To produce a high quality and usable logging suite for Borland's Delphi loosely based on the Log4J package.</em></p>
    	</section>
    	<section>
    		<title>Project Goals</title>
    		<p>The project has three main goals:</p>
    		<dl>
    		    <dt>Simplicity</dt>
    		    <dd>Simplicity should drive everything, the suite should be simple to understand and simple to use.</dd>
    		    <dt>Loosely based on Log4J</dt>
    		    <dd>The Log4J package is a mature logging package for the Java Platform. Log4Delphi is based on that package in such a way that those who know and understand Log4J will easily pick up and learn Log4Delphi.</dd>
    		    <dt>Flexible</dt>
    		    <dd>Log4Delphi should be flexible enough to easily integrate into new and existing Delphi projects, by following standard Delphi practices.</dd>
    		</dl>

    	<section>
    		<title>Project Development</title>
    		<p>Project development follows three basic principles:</p>
    		<ul>
    		    <li>collaborative software development with respectful, honest, technical-based interaction</li>
    		    <li>commercial-friendly standard license</li>
    		    <li>consistently high quality software</li>
    		</ul>
    	</section>
    	<section>
    		<title>Project Methodology</title>
    		<p>The project employs the eXtreme Programming methodology focussing on three core principles:</p>
    		<dl>
    		    <dt>Frequent Releases</dt>
    		    <dd>The project aims to have a release every month, with each release introducing one new feature.</dd>
    		    <dt>Test Driven Development</dt>
    		    <dd>Unit testing allows the code base to be easily refactored without breaking any existing code.</dd>
    		    <dt>Refactoring</dt>
    		    <dd>Constantly improving the code base through refactoring.</dd>
    		</dl>
